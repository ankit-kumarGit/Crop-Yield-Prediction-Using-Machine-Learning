# Crop-Yield-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
Crop Yield Prediction using ML analyzes weather and soil parameters (NPK, pH, temperature, rainfall) to estimate crop yield. This project involves data preprocessing, outlier handling, and machine learning models to help improve sustainable agriculture and optimize farming practices.
